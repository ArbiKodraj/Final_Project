# Function Approximation via Machine Learning Methods

The notebook FunctionApproximation.ipynb contains my work for the final project in EPP. 

I decided to use [![Code Style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

The best way to access this notebook is by downloading it [here](https://github.com/ArbiKodraj/Final_Project_EPP) and open it locally via jupyter notebook. Alternatively, it can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ArbiKodraj/Final_Project_EPP/blob/master/FunctionApproximation.ipynb), online on github. Other ways to view this notebook are binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArbiKodraj/microeconometrics-course-project-ArbiKodraj.git/master) or nbviewer <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArbiKodraj/microeconometrics-course-project-ArbiKodraj/blob/master/ReplicationProject.ipynb"

</a>, however these are not the preferred options, because when opening the notebook it can happen that some outputs are displayed incompletely.
